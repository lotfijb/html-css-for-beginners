## Who is this for  🧑‍🤝‍🧑
``` HTML
<h3>Absolute beginners</h3>
<p>If you are new to web development and want to try to build websites from scratch, this repository is for you.</p>
<p>This will be like your first step into front end development and note that you will not learn everything 
simply because nobody has all knowledge, so this is just to make you gain time and know where to start.</p>
```

## What's in this repository  🔑
```javascript
console.log("You will find HTML & CSS resources and best practices for beginners.")
```

## What will you learn through this  📓
* How does the web work ?
* HTML basics
* CSS basics

## What is HTML ?
[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
## What is CSS ?
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML, it describes how elements should be rendered on screen.

## How will you learn  👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
You will find ordered folders so you don't think a lot about where to start, in each folder you will find all types of resources (videos, courses, books, etc..) because not everyone likes to learn through books, for example, you might prefer a video etc..
You will find all you need and it's up to you to pick what suits you the best.
* It's a self paced learning process so feel free to learn whenever you want. JUST BE CONSISTENT WITH IT.
* A file with web design inspirations is for you to get your hands on the keyboard and inspire from thousands of amazing and creative websites for your next project.

## Why am I making this ❓
It's not because you can't make a google search and find resources, or it is hard for you to find a [front end roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend), when I started to learn web development last year, I got lost, internet is filled with books and courses and you don't exactly know as a starter which one to pick so I decided to make this so you go straight to your point.

## Final notes ✍️
* I will do my best to keep this updated with new exercices and helpful resources.
* This is not the perfect way to start web dev as there are plenty of other methods to do it, this just worked for me and it might work for you too.
* Consistency is key to learn how to code.
* [Setting up your development environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2gvHxC9gFY) : This is a good beginner-friendly setup to start with (I will share my configuration and setup if you want to follow it.)
* KEEP LEARNING AND GOOD LUCK.
