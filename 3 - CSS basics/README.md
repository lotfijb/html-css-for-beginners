# CSS : Cascading Style Sheets
Itis a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) or [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen.

# Courses to get you started  
- [W3Schools CSS Course](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) : A structured CSS course is provided by W3schools. W3schools provides a built-in web code editor, which can be used to write and run your CSS code online. After every topic, it provides you with short quizzes as well to test your knowledge.

- [Scrimba Free CSS Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/introtocss) : It is a 1 hour course where you will learn everything you need to start styling your web pages and I do recommend Scrimba because it is the next-generation platform for learning how to code. The screencasts enable you to interact with the code directly in the player.

# IMPORTANT TO KNOW :exclamation::exclamation:
It's very easy to get started with CSS. With just a few hours of training, you can easily style texts, elements and layouts. However, it becomes progressively difficult and soon you'll come to a situation where your code starts getting quite messy so you need to get your hands on the keyboard to get familiar with the language.
