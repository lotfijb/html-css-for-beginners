# NOTES :
- Start with other resources ( courses, youtube playlists ) because these books dive deep into what HTML really is and you don't need most of it in the beginning, you will figure it out along the way.
- Books can take you so much longer and you don't need to waste a lot of your time with HTML as it is easy to grasp and understand.
- If you really wanna know pretty much everything about HTML then you are in the right place BUT "You don't need to learn everything about HTML to start building web pages"
