# HTML : HyperText Markup Language
It is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structureof web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) or functionality/behavior [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

# Courses to get you started  
- [W3Schools HTML Course](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) : A structured HTML course is provided by W3schools. W3schools provides a built-in web code editor, which can be used to write and run your HTML code online. After every topic, it provides you with short quizzes as well to test your knowledge.

- [Scrimba Free HTML Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/html) : It is a 57 min course where you will learn everything you need to start structuring your web pages and I do recommend Scrimba because it is the next-generation platform for learning how to code. The screencasts enable you to interact with the code directly in the player.

The basics of HTML are pretty easy for the average learner to grasp. If you want to learn it, patience and practice are your only ways to get there and it shouldn't take you more than week or two with discipline and commitment to learn.
