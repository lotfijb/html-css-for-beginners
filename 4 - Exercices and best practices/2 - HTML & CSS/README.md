- ## Landing page ()
Making a stunning landing page simply requires knowledge of HTML and CSS. You’ll need to design columns and margins, arrange items in columns and boxes, and use both your HTML and artistic skills to produce an effective landing page.
A landing page requires a lot of ingenuity to create. You will practise adding a header and footer, making columns, aligning items, creating sections, and doing many other things. You must apply CSS with caution and bear in mind that various elements should not overlap one another. You will also be responsible for using colour contrasts, padding, margins, and spaces between paragraphs, sections, and boxes.

- ## Clone Google website ()
Yes, you have seen it many times. But can you replicate it. The simple google.com page with icons, google’s logo, a text box and two buttons. You can make a look-alike of google.com page. Don't forget, you are making it look like google.com not function like google.com.

- ## Clone Facebook login/signup page ()
