# MOTIVATION :muscle:
To help you move from where you are today to where you want to be tomorrow, in any field, you have to invest time, energy and be committed to what are you trying to learn.

### Just write some code, EVERY DAY :calendar:
If you want to get good at something, it has to become a daily habit - a routine you don't skip.

- First, 'practice makes perfect' as known, all of those hours of development that you will put in add up fast, you will have your own projects done, plenty of techniques firmly established in your skillset. This experience is crucial for you to land exciting jobs.
- Second, writing code every day will make you feel like a developer , as simple as that. You will stop feeling like a "wannabe developer" and this will boost your confidence and feed your motivation.

Here comes the most important question : How much practice should you make space for ?

There is no perfect answer for this, it depends on your availability and most importantly your desire to learn.

Try aiming for one hour each day and note that it's okay to fall short - no one is perfect and 30 min is better than 0 - but make one hour as your goal.

### Contribute to Open-source projects  
- Open source contribution can be an amazing learning experience. It allows you to give back to and be a part of communities that build valuable open source projects. - It enables you to make already made websites better. Although it can be tough to start, once you get the hang of it, it is immensely rewarding.
- It is a great way to flex your development muscles :muscle: and it will put your learning into real world projects.
